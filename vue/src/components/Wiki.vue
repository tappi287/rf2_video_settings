      <h6 class="mt-1">Pin to taskbar</h6>
      <p>If you want to pin this app to your taskbar: type rf2 into your Windows start menu and right click the
        rf2 Settings Widget app entry > Pin to taskbar. If you try to pin the running app, you'll pin
        a shortcut to your web browser.</p>

      <h6 class="mt-5">Report a bug</h6>
      <p>Want to report a bug, request a feature or have a setting you're missing? Head over to GitHub and
        <b-link class="text-rf-orange" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tappi287/rf2_video_settings/issues">
          create an issue
        </b-link>.
      </p>

      <h6 class="mt-5">Import</h6>
      <p>You can import preset JSON files, exported from this app, by simply dragging them into the application window!
      This also works for rFactors player.JSON files. Simply drop it on the application and it will import all the
      settings available in this widget(and only those!).</p>
      <i>This is handy if you import someone else's player.JSON and want to make sure you are not overwriting all your
      other settings like your Player Name and Nickname.</i>

      <h6 class="mt-5">Server Browser</h6>
      <p>The Server Browser uses Steam's API to query server information. The number of connected players and
      names of the connected players does most likely not reflect the actual number of players.
      The information should be similar to what you see when launching Steam>View>Server</p>

      <h6 class="mt-5">rF2 Notes</h6>
      <p>Start rF2 while a dedicated server is running on the same machine: Change the WebUI Port in player.json
      to something different than the default value. Use this app to start rF2 or create a shortcut to rF2.exe
      and set the StartIn parameter to the rFactor 2 root directory.</p>
      <p></p>
      <span>Start rF2 from command line and join a password protected server: </span>
      <pre class="text-muted">rFactor2.exe +multiplayer +connect=:Password@IP:Port</pre>
      <p></p>
      <span>Server XY won't let you join: Unable to install server mod. Take a look at your:</span>
      <pre class="text-muted mb-0">rFactor 2\UserData\cmpReport.txt</pre>
      <span>If you find messages like component XY missing: try to un- and resubscribe to that Item in the
      Steam Workshop.</span>
      <p></p>
      <span>Your ModMgr.exe is not starting. The registry key for the packages and rFactor directory
      is most likely out of date. Take a look at these Windows registry keys:</span>
